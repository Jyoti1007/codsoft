First Project: Number Guessing Game
====================================
First the instructions will be shown, for this  I have created Instructions class...then
I have created a NumberGussingGame class that extends JFrame to build the GUI for the number guessing game. I generated a random number within a specified range (1 to100) as the target number.
Users enter their guesses in a text field and click a "Guess" button to submit their guess. A message is provided on whether the guess is correct, too large or too less.
The game can be played for a limited number of attempts (5 in this example), and the number of rounds played (here only 3 rounds)and rounds won is tracked.
The game can be reset for a new round when a round is won or when the user runs out of attempts.
It includes following files(Instructions.java, NumberGuessingGame.java,giphy.gif, inst.png)
